  <Step title="Make your first request">
    Now let's retrieve your Gmail user profile. Choose your preferred approach:
    
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="AI Playground">
        **Best for: AI agents and agentic workflows**
        
        1. Click the **"Try in Playground"** button (top right of the connections page)
        2. In the AI chat, paste this prompt:
        
        ```
        Get my Gmail user profile
        ```
        
        3. The AI will execute the action and return your profile information
        
        The Playground lets you test integration actions conversationally. It's perfect for exploring what's possible before building your agent or workflow.
        
        <Tip>
          Try any request such as "Fetch my last 3 unread emails from Gmail" or "Send an email to hello@picaos.com with a warm greeting"
        </Tip>
      </Tab>
      
      <Tab title="Direct API">
        **Best for: Direct integration building and custom workflows**
        
        First, gather your credentials:
        1. Get your [API key](https://app.picaos.com/settings/api-keys) from the settings page
        2. Copy your Gmail connection key from the [connections table](https://app.picaos.com/connections)
        
        Then make a request to the Passthrough API:
        
        ```bash
        curl "https://api.picaos.com/v1/passthrough/users/me/profile" \
          -H "x-pica-secret: YOUR_PICA_SECRET_KEY" \
          -H "x-pica-connection-key: YOUR_GMAIL_CONNECTION_KEY" \
          -H "x-pica-action-id: conn_mod_def::F_JeCYGuzvg::yAM6bqGdRdm91ZbYejlbEA" \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json"
        ```
        
        Replace `YOUR_PICA_SECRET_KEY` and `YOUR_GMAIL_CONNECTION_KEY` with your actual values.
