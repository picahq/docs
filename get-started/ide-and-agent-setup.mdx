    Cursor is an AI-powered code editor that can significantly accelerate your development with Pica. Follow these steps to set it up optimally.
    
    ### Install the Pica MCP Server
    
    The Model Context Protocol (MCP) server gives Cursor direct access to Pica's integration knowledge and request-building capabilities. With the MCP server installed, you can prompt Cursor to construct integration requests based on your specific needs.
    
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Open MCP Settings">
        In Cursor, open the MCP Settings panel from the settings menu.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Add the Pica MCP Server">
        Add the following configuration to your MCP settings:
        
        ```json
        {
          "mcpServers": {
            "pica": {
              "command": "npx",
              "args": [
                "@picahq/mcp"
              ],
              "env": {
                "PICA_SECRET": "your-api-key"
              }
            }
          }
        }
        ```
        
        Replace `your-api-key` with your actual [Pica API key](https://app.picaos.com/settings/api-keys).
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Verify setup">
        Once configured, Cursor can now construct Pica integration requests for you. Just describe what you want to build in natural language.

        </Frame>
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Example Prompts">
        Here are some examples of what you can ask Cursor to build with Pica:
        
        **Check your connections**
        - What connections do I have in my Pica account?
        - Do I have a connection to Google Calendar?
        
        **Fetch data from integrations**
        - Add an endpoint that uses Pica to fetch the list of contacts from Salesforce
        - Using Pica, add an endpoint that fetches the list of invoices from QuickBooks and displays them in a table
        - Build a paginatable table component that fetches and displays QuickBooks invoices with search and sort using Pica
        
        **Send data to integrations**
        - When my form is submitted, use Pica to send an email using Gmail
        - Using Pica, create a new lead in HubSpot when a user signs up
        - Create a page with a form that can post messages to multiple Slack channels with message scheduling using Pica
        
        **Query Pica knowledge**
        - What fields are available when to create a QuickBooks invoice?
        - What's the response schema for listing my HubSpot contacts?
        - What are the filter options for fetching Gmail emails?
        
        <Tip>
          The MCP server has access to all integration schemas, authentication patterns, and edge cases. The more specific your prompt, the better the generated code.
        </Tip>
      </Step>
    </Steps>
    
    ### Index Pica Documentation
    
    Cursor can index external documentation, making it easy to ask questions about Pica and get contextual answers while you code.
    
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Open Codebase Indexing Settings">
        1. Open Cursor Settings (`Cmd/Ctrl + ,`)
        2. Navigate to **Features** â†’ **Codebase indexing**
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Add Pica Documentation">
        Add the Pica documentation URL to your indexed sources:
        
        ```
        https://docs.picaos.com
        ```
        
        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/ide-setup/cursor-indexing.png" alt="Documentation indexing in Cursor" />
        </Frame>
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Verify setup">
        Once indexed, Cursor will have access to the documentation. You can now ask questions about Pica directly in the chat.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Example Questions">
        Here are some examples of questions you can ask:
        
        - What can Pica help me do?
        - How can I add AuthKit to my app?
        - What API can I use to list the available connections I have in my Pica account?
        - What is the Passthrough API?
        
        <Info>
          Documentation indexing works alongside the MCP server. Use the MCP server to build integration features, and use documentation indexing to learn about Pica's products and APIs.
