## Scoped API Keys

Organizations and Projects each have their own API keys that are automatically scoped to that specific context. This provides secure, isolated access to resources.

### Organization API Keys

Organization-scoped API keys provide access to:
- All projects within the organization
- Organization-level connections and secrets
- Organization-level AuthKit configurations
- All resources the API key creator has permission to access

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to API Keys">
    From your organization dashboard, go to **API Keys** in the sidebar.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create API Key">
    Click **Create API Key** and provide a descriptive name for the key.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Copy Key">
    **Important:** Copy the API key immediately. For security reasons, it will only be displayed once.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use in Your Application">
    Use this API key in your application to access organization resources:
    
    ```bash
    curl https://api.picaos.com/v1/vault/connections \
      -H "x-pica-secret: your_organization_api_key"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Project API Keys

Project-scoped API keys provide access to:
- Resources only within that specific project
- Project-level connections and secrets
- Project-level AuthKit configurations
- Isolated from other projects in the organization

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Project API Keys">
    From your project dashboard, go to **API Keys** in the sidebar.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create Project API Key">
    Click **Create API Key** and provide a descriptive name.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Copy Key">
    **Important:** Copy the API key immediately. It will only be displayed once for security.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use in Your Application">
    Use this project-scoped API key to access only that project's resources:
    
    ```bash
    curl https://api.picaos.com/v1/connections \
      -H "x-pica-secret: your_project_api_key"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Security Best Practices:**
- Never expose API keys in client-side code or version control
- Use project-scoped keys when you only need access to specific project resources
- Rotate API keys regularly, especially if they may have been compromised
- Delete unused API keys immediately
</Warning>
