## What can you build?

With Pica, you can build integration features with **any of the 150+ integrations** available in our catalog—from CRMs like Salesforce and HubSpot, to communication tools like Gmail and Slack, to accounting platforms like QuickBooks and Stripe.

**Common integration patterns:**

- Sync data from customer CRMs, calendars, or project management tools into your app
- Automate emails, notifications, or updates across integrated platforms  
- Pull reports and analytics from accounting, marketing, or sales tools
- Create records, update statuses, or trigger actions in third-party systems
- Build custom workflows that connect multiple tools together

## How it works

Pica provides two core components for building SaaS integrations:

### 1. AuthKit: Let users connect their accounts

[AuthKit](/authkit) is an embeddable UI component that lets your users securely connect their third-party accounts (Gmail, Slack, Salesforce, QuickBooks, etc.) directly in your app. Think of it as "Plaid for integrations."

AuthKit handles OAuth flows, token management, and secure credential storage so you never have to touch or store user credentials. When a user connects an integration, you get a `connectionKey` that you'll use to make authenticated requests on their behalf.

### 2. Passthrough API: Make authenticated requests

The [Passthrough API](/api-reference/passthrough) lets you make authenticated HTTP requests to any third-party API without managing credentials.

**What it does:**
- Provides a unified endpoint for 25,000+ actions across 150+ platforms
- Automatically authenticates requests using stored connection credentials
- Uses the same request/response schemas as the underlying API
- Handles rate limiting, retries, and error responses
- Returns data directly from the integration (no storage on Pica's side)

**Building requests:**

You can construct Passthrough API requests using:
1. The underlying API's documentation (same schemas apply)
2. The [Pica MCP Server](/sdk/mcp) which uses Pica's knowledge base to write requests for you—saving hours of reading through API docs

**Finding action IDs:**

Every integration action has a unique action ID. Find them in:
1. The [Pica dashboard tools page](https://app.picaos.com/tools)
2. The [Available Actions API](/api-reference/core/available-actions)
3. Using the [Pica MCP Server](/sdk/mcp) in your IDE

## Complete integration workflow

Here's how all the pieces work together in a typical SaaS application.

<Note>
**Two approaches for connections:**
- **Customer integrations** - Use [AuthKit](/authkit) to let your users connect their own accounts (recommended for multi-tenant apps)
- **Your integrations** - Connect integrations directly in the [Pica dashboard](https://app.picaos.com/connections) and use those for all users (simpler for single-account use cases)
</Note>

  <Tab title="With AuthKit">
    ### Customer-facing integrations
    
    Let your users connect their own third-party accounts through your app.
    
    <Steps>
      <Step title="User connects their account">
        User clicks "Connect Gmail" in your app → AuthKit modal opens → User authenticates → Connection created with a unique `connectionKey`
        
        ```typescript
        // Frontend: Open AuthKit
        const { open } = useAuthKit({
          token: { url: "/api/authkit" },
          onSuccess: async (connection) => {
            // Save connection to your database
            await saveConnection(currentUser.id, connection);
          }
        });
        ```
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Store connection metadata">
        Save the connection key to your database associated with the user. You'll use this key to make requests on their behalf.
        
        ```typescript
        // Backend: Save to database
        await db.connections.create({
          userId: currentUser.id,
          platform: "gmail",
          connectionKey: connection.connectionKey,
          connectedAt: new Date()
        });
        ```
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Make authenticated requests">
        Use the Passthrough API with the user's connection key to access their data or perform actions.
        
        ```typescript
        // Backend: Fetch user's Gmail emails
        const userConnection = await db.connections.findOne({
          userId: currentUser.id,
          platform: "gmail"
        });
        
        const emails = await fetch(
          "https://api.picaos.com/v1/passthrough/users/me/messages",
          {
            headers: {
              "x-pica-secret": process.env.PICA_SECRET_KEY,
              "x-pica-connection-key": userConnection.connectionKey,
              "x-pica-action-id": "conn_mod_def::F_JeJ3qaLEg::v9ICSQZxR0un5_ketxbCAQ"
            }
          }
        ).then(r => r.json());
        ```
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Build features with the data">
        Process the data and display it in your app, sync it to your database, or use it in your workflows.
        
        ```typescript
        // Frontend: Display emails in your UI
        return (
          <div>
            <h2>Your Emails</h2>
            {emails.messages.map(email => (
              <EmailCard key={email.id} email={email} />
            ))}
          </div>
        );
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Without AuthKit">
    ### Using your own integrations
    
    If you don't need each user to connect their own accounts, you can connect integrations directly in the Pica dashboard and use those for all your users.
    
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Connect in Pica dashboard">
        Go to the [Pica dashboard](https://app.picaos.com/connections) and connect the integrations you need (e.g., your company Gmail, Slack workspace, CRM account).
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Copy connection key">
        Copy the connection key from the dashboard and store it in your environment variables.
        
        ```bash .env
        PICA_SECRET_KEY=your_api_key
        GMAIL_CONNECTION_KEY=your_gmail_connection_key
        ```
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Make authenticated requests">
        Use the Passthrough API with your connection key to access integration data.
        
        ```typescript
        // Backend: Use your own connection for all users
        const emails = await fetch(
          "https://api.picaos.com/v1/passthrough/users/me/messages",
          {
            headers: {
              "x-pica-secret": process.env.PICA_SECRET_KEY,
              "x-pica-connection-key": process.env.GMAIL_CONNECTION_KEY,
              "x-pica-action-id": "conn_mod_def::F_JeJ3qaLEg::v9ICSQZxR0un5_ketxbCAQ"
            }
          }
        ).then(r => r.json());
        ```
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Build features with the data">
        Use the data in your application—all users will see data from your connected account.

          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use the API playground" icon="gamepad">
    Test integration actions in the [Pica dashboard playground](https://app.picaos.com):
    1. Connect your test account
    2. Use the AI playground to test actions conversationally
    3. Copy the working code to your application
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Store connection keys securely" icon="lock">
    Best practices for storing connection metadata:
    - Save connection keys in your database encrypted at rest
    - Associate connections with user IDs for multi-tenancy
    - Store platform name, connection status, and created date
    - Index by userId and platform for fast lookups
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Handle connection errors gracefully" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Connection errors can happen (expired tokens, revoked access, rate limits). Handle them gracefully:
    
    ```typescript
    try {
      const data = await makePassthroughRequest(connectionKey);
      return data;
    } catch (error) {
      if (error.status === 401) {
        // Token expired - prompt user to reconnect
        await notifyUserToReconnect(userId, platform);
      } else if (error.status === 429) {
        // Rate limited - retry with backoff
        await retryWithBackoff(() => makePassthroughRequest(connectionKey));
      } else {
        // Other error - log and notify
        console.error("Integration error:", error);
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Monitor usage and errors" icon="chart-line">
    Track your integration usage in the [Pica dashboard](https://app.picaos.com):
    - View API request logs and response times
    - Monitor error rates by integration
    - Set up alerts for authentication failures
    - Track which integrations your users connect most
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security best practices

<Warning>
Never expose your Pica API key in frontend code. API keys should only be used on your backend server.
</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Protect API keys" icon="key">
    - Store API keys in environment variables
    - Never commit API keys to version control
    - Rotate API keys periodically
    - Use separate keys for development and production
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Validate user ownership" icon="shield-check">
    Always verify that the requesting user owns the connection before making requests:
    
    ```typescript
    async function getUserEmails(requestingUserId: string, connectionId: string) {
      // Verify the connection belongs to the requesting user
      const connection = await db.connections.findOne({
        id: connectionId,
        userId: requestingUserId
      });
      
      if (!connection) {
        throw new Error("Unauthorized: Connection not found");
      }
      
      // Now safe to use the connection
      return await fetchEmails(connection.connectionKey);
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use HTTPS everywhere" icon="lock">
    Always serve your application over HTTPS in production to protect tokens and connection keys in transit.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Implement rate limiting" icon="gauge">
    Add rate limiting to your API endpoints to prevent abuse:
    
    ```typescript
    import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit';
    
    const limiter = rateLimit({
      windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
      max: 100 // limit each user to 100 requests per window
    });
    
    app.use('/api/integrations/', limiter);
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Audit connection usage" icon="clipboard-list">
    Log and monitor integration usage for security audits:
    
    ```typescript
    async function logIntegrationUsage(userId: string, action: string, platform: string) {
      await db.auditLog.create({
        userId,
        action,
        platform,
        timestamp: new Date(),
        ipAddress: req.ip
      });
    }
    ```
