## Overview

Everyday is a natural language interface built on Pica that provides unified access to multiple productivity platforms. Users can execute tasks across Slack, Notion, Gmail, and other connected tools using conversational commands, eliminating the need for context-switching between applications.

> The platform translates natural language inputs into tool-specific API calls, handling authentication, data formatting, and cross-platform synchronization automatically.
