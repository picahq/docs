## Steps

1. **Connect Linear and Google Sheets**  
   Set up API keys for Linear and Google Sheets.

2. **Configure the Agent Tool**  
   Use the following prompt to instruct your agent:
   ```markdown
   Create me a tool called getDailyUpdates in my agent for fetching today’s tickets from Linear, saving them into Google Sheets in a well-structured, easy-to-read format, grouped by assignee and status (In Progress / Closed).
   ```

3. **Run the Agent**  
   Trigger the tool and check your Google Sheet for today’s tickets, grouped by assignee and status.

## Environment Variables

- `LINEAR_API_KEY`
- `GOOGLE_SHEETS_API_KEY`
- `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID`

## Example Output

Your Google Sheet will show today’s Linear tickets, grouped by assignee, with separate sections for In Progress and Closed tickets.
