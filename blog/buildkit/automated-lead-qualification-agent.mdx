### Key Actions Used

This automation leverages 4 core actions across the three platforms:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Gmail: List User Messages" icon="envelope">
    Fetches recent emails with the "Leads" label for processing
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="HubSpot: Create Contact" icon="user-plus">
    Creates new contact records for qualified leads with extracted information
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="HubSpot: Retrieve Contacts" icon="search">
    Checks for existing contacts to prevent duplicates
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Slack: Post Message" icon="message">
    Sends formatted notifications to the sales team channel
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Using the System

Once your system is set up, you can use this prompt to process lead inquiries:

```
Qualify today's lead inquiry emails from Gmail: for each email with the "Leads" label, extract sender details and qualify based on high intent signals (mentions budget over $5K, urgent timeline, specific product interest); if qualified with score >7/10, create a new contact in HubSpot with extracted information and lead source "Email Inquiry"; then send a Slack notification to #sales-leads channel with lead summary, qualification reasoning, and HubSpot contact link. Only process emails from the last 24 hours.
```

### Qualification Criteria

The AI evaluates leads based on these factors:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="High-Value Indicators (Score +2-3 points each)">
    - Mentions specific budget amount over $5,000
    - Indicates urgent timeline (immediate, ASAP, this week/month)
    - References specific products/services by name
    - Includes company name and professional email domain
    - Mentions existing pain points or current solutions
  </Accordion>
