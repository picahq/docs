<ConnectAccounts platformNames='Gmail and Notion accounts'/>
<AddConnections platforms={[{'name': 'Gmail', 'code': 'gmail'}, {'name': 'Notion', 'code': 'notion'}]} />

### Required Environment Variables

You'll need these connection keys in your environment:

```bash Environment Setup
GMAIL_CONNECTION_KEY=your_gmail_connection_key
NOTION_CONNECTION_KEY=your_notion_connection_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
PICA_API_KEY=your_pica_api_key
```

### Using the System

Once your system is set up, you can use natural language prompts to process job applications. Here's an example prompt format:

```
Process today's job applications - fetch emails, analyze candidates, create Notion pages, generate tasks, and send response emails using the notion db id: {your_notion_database_id}
```

Replace `{your_notion_database_id}` with your actual Notion database ID. This command will:
- Fetch new job application emails from Gmail
- Analyze candidate resumes and extract key information
- Create pages in your Notion Job Applications database
- Generate appropriate tasks based on the role
- Send automated response emails to candidates

### Notion Database Setup

The system will create two linked databases in your Notion workspace:

  <Tab title="Job Applications Database">
    **Database Name:** "Job Applications"
    
    **Properties:**
    - Candidate Name (Title)
