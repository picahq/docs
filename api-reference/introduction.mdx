Pica provides powerful APIs that enable you to build, deploy, and scale AI agents with seamless access to over 100+ integrations and tools. 
Connect your AI to QuickBooks, Salesforce, HubSpot, Shopify, and more leading platforms through our Unified API via Common Models to unlock real-time data and automation capabilities.

## Vault API
The Vault API provides endpoints to manage your connectors through listing, deleting, and viewing connection details.

## Unified API 
Our standardized API layer enables LLMs to interact with third-party services through common models. Features include:

- Integration with QuickBooks, Salesforce, HubSpot, Shopify and [more](https://www.picaos.com/community/connectors)
- Standard CRUD operations across all connectors
- Built-in authentication and connection management
- AI SDK support for LLM capabilities

## Transaction Keys

A `transactionKey` is a unique ID returned as part of the response body for every Pica API response. The `transactionKey` can be used to look up the request in the [logs](https://app.picaos.com/logs) and should be included when contacting Support regarding a specific API call.
