<InstallMcpServer />
<ConnectAccounts platformNames='Twelve Data, News Data IO, and Notion accounts'/>
<AddConnections platforms={[{'name': 'Twelve Data', 'code': 'twelve-data'}, {'name': 'News Data IO', 'code': 'news-data-io'}, {'name': 'Notion', 'code': 'notion'}]} />

### Required Environment Variables

You'll need these connection keys in your environment:

```bash Environment Setup
TWELVE_DATA_CONNECTION_KEY=your_twelve_data_connection_key
NEWS_DATA_IO_CONNECTION_KEY=your_news_data_io_connection_key
NOTION_CONNECTION_KEY=your_notion_connection_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
PICA_API_KEY=your_pica_api_key
```

### Using the System

Once your system is set up, you can use prompts to conduct investment research. Here's an example prompt format:

```
Research AAPL stock - fetch current price, technical indicators, recent financial news, analyst recommendations, and create a comprehensive investment research note in Notion database: {your_notion_database_id}
```

Replace `{your_notion_database_id}` with your actual Notion database ID. This command will:
- Fetch real-time stock price and market data
- Calculate key technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Moving Averages)
- Gather recent financial news and market sentiment
- Retrieve analyst recommendations and price targets
- Create a comprehensive research page in your Notion Investment Research database

### Notion Database Setup

The system will create a comprehensive Investment Research database in your Notion workspace:
