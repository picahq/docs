      NOTION STRUCTURE:
      Create two linked databases:
      1. "Job Applications" database with candidate information
      2. "Application Tasks" database with role-specific tasks linked to applications

      TASK GENERATION BY ROLE:
      - Software: Coding challenge, system design, code review task
      - Business: Case study analysis, market research, strategy presentation  
      - Sales: Sales pitch creation, CRM scenario, client outreach plan
      - Marketing: Campaign proposal, content creation, analytics interpretation
