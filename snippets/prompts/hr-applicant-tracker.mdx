      Create a comprehensive LangChain tool suite for automated job application processing using Pica integrations. Build the following tools:

      CORE TOOLS:
      1. JobApplicationEmailFetcher - LangChain tool that fetches Gmail emails from last 24 hours with job application keywords
      2. ResumeContentExtractor - Tool that extracts structured resume data from email content
      3. GPTResumeAnalyzer - Tool that uses OpenAI to analyze and categorize resume content
      4. TaskGenerator - Tool that generates role-specific tasks based on candidate profile
      5. NotionJobTracker - Tool that creates Notion pages with embedded task information
      6. JobApplicationTaskUpdater - Tool that updates job application pages with task details
      7. AutomatedEmailResponder - Tool that sends personalized response emails

      LANGCHAIN IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
      - Use LangChain's tool decorator and structured input/output schemas
      - Implement proper error handling with LangChain's error types
      - Use LangChain's memory system to track application processing state
      - Integrate with LangChain agents for orchestrating the workflow
      - Support streaming responses for real-time processing updates

      JOB ROLE CATEGORIZATION:
      - Software: Look for programming languages, frameworks, technical skills
      - Business: Look for MBA, business analysis, strategy, consulting keywords  
      - Sales: Look for CRM, sales targets, client management, revenue keywords
      - Marketing: Look for digital marketing, campaigns, SEO, social media keywords
      - Operations: Look for process improvement, logistics, supply chain keywords

      SIMPLIFIED NOTION STRUCTURE (Single Database):
      Create one "Job Applications" database with embedded task fields:
      - Candidate information fields (name, email, phone, etc.)
      - Task 1 fields (title, type, deadline, instructions)
      - Task 2 fields (title, type, deadline, instructions)  
      - Task 3 fields (title, type, deadline, instructions)
      - This eliminates complex database relationships and property matching issues

      TASK GENERATION BY ROLE:
      - Software: Coding challenge, system design, code review task
      - Business: Case study analysis, market research, strategy presentation  
      - Sales: Sales pitch creation, CRM scenario, client outreach plan
      - Marketing: Campaign proposal, content creation, analytics interpretation
      - Operations: Process optimization, workflow design, efficiency analysis

      Use Pica integrations for Gmail, Notion, and email sending. The embedded task approach ensures no database relationship errors and simpler data management.
